# Nix by Example

[Nix](http://nixos.org/nix/) is a powerful functional package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes package management reliable and reproducible.

It provides atomic upgrades and rollbacks, side-by-side installation of multiple versions of a package, multi-user package management and easy setup of build environments.

Python developers can think of it as a language-agnostic virtualenv.
