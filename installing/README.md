# Installing Nix

Nix is a package manager not unlike pip, Bundler, npm or
Bower. Installing Nix for a single user is very simple and works on
almost every standard Linux system.


> **Note** <br>Nix installs itself in your root directory under `/nix`
and can grow quite large. A fresh installation with a few packages is
~500MiB, but a long-running system with lots of packages can grow to
15-20 GiB.
